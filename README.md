# Why Wordpress is not good?
1. Security Vulnerability<br>
   The biggest disadvantage is the platform’s popularity with hackers. You don’t even need to know how to hack to compromise WordPress. There are plenty of downloadable scripts that you can run against a WordPress site to find vulnerabilities. If you work with WordPress, one main daily task you’ll need to do is update plugins and scan for any security risks. You can install security plugins to help protect your site.
<br><br>
   Two common security plugins are WordFence and Sucuri. Sucuri scans your site periodically for vulnerabilities, and WordFence protects your site’s administration login section. Using these two plugins help with security, but it doesn’t completely protect your site. WordPress sites must be closely monitored, and the plugins you install should only be from trusted developers.

2. Limited Customization and Scalability<br>
   Even with the numerous WordPress advantages, using a standard site platform for an eCommerce store limits your ability to customize much of the site. You can hire a developer to customize your WordPress installation, but they are still bound to the WordPress API.
   <br><br>
   Your developer can even customize WooCommerce or any other eCommerce plugin you install, but some of these customizations take more time than just creating a unique site. The limitations can also grow to become a scalability problem if your site increases in sales requirements and customer needs.
### Why WordPress not fit for ecommerce


1. It’s not built for ecommerce specifically<br>
   While WordPress does have plugins to make your site ecommerce-friendly, it’s not an ecommerce site builder. You can create dozens of different types of sites with WordPress.
   <br><br>
   Since WordPress isn’t ecommerce-focused, you may miss out on some crucial features you need for your ecommerce store. You may miss out on these features simply because you don’t think of them or don’t know if there’s a plugin available to have that feature.
   <br><br>
   For example, if you didn’t think about getting a plugin for cart abandonment, you’ll miss out on that feature entirely because you didn’t install a plugin for it. On an ecommerce platform, though, features like that are typically already integrated, so you don’t have to think twice about it.
   <br><br>
   Missing out on features like this can impact your sales and overall revenue.

2. Some plugins don’t play well together
   One of the biggest struggles with WordPress is getting all the plugins to work. Some plugins may not be compatible with one another, which can create headaches when you’re trying to build your site.

### Conclusion 
Wordpress is good for small scale project like company website, small stores, but if you wanted to move to larger scale and larger databased you should move to Custom solutions like other companies does, Wordpress is design for larger database, 
Wordpress always have compatibility issues with Plugins, Slow response from database. 
Wordpress allow to developer to make things to bypass wordpress standard 
but it will take long time for development.
If you choose custom development then you have open place to do anything, like custom dashboard for vendors, employees/staff, customers, make logs of every activity,
fast databased, easy to debug, easy to add features,

We recommend you to go for Custom Development if you wanted to move to large scale, or MultiVendors
